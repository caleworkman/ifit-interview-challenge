 [Demo](https://caleworkman.github.io/ifit-interview-challenge/)

 This project was created with Create-React-App. Styling was based on the provided Sketch file from iFit, except that all fonts are Open Sans.

 ## Optional Completed Tasks

 ### Animation
 - Hero text fades in and slides down slightly.
 - All cards have a hover effect where a shadow is applied and the scale is increased slightly.
 - When the iFit-enabled equipment section is in view, the cards fade-in and shrink to their final size.


 ### JavaScript
 - The review slider functions and animates. The reviews cycle and are based on a custom `CircularDLL` class.
 - The language picker in the bottom left corner selects a language. Note the language does not actually change but a state variable is updated and reflected in the dropdown.
 - The two navigation bars are fixed until you scroll past the hero section, after which they disappear.
